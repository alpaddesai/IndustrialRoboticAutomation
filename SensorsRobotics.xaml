                    <Run Text="Various types of sensors are being utilized in Robotics, these sensors apply different measurement techniques and utilize different interfaces to controller. Sample applications of sensors include tactile sensor with a binary signal, an inclinometer with an analog signal, a gyroscope with a timing signal, a GPS modules with a serial link and a digital camera with a parallel link. Examples of passive and internal sensors include battery sensor, chip temp sensor, gyroscope and external passive sensors include an on board cameras. Active external sensors include sonar sensor, infrared distance sensor and laser scanner.    A sonar transducer on a robotic system can be utilized to detect the distance of obstacles.  Sonar sensors can be replaced with laser sensors for mobile robot systems.  The laser sensors can return a 2D or 3D distance map of the obstacle.  The pulsed infrared (IR) distance sensors combined with an infrared detector array  can be utilized to create a 3D distance map.   A compass is utilized for self localization within many mobile robot applications.  The autonomous robot relies on its on board sensors to keep track of its current position and orientation.     Orientation sensors are utilized to determine a robot's orientation in 3D spaces. These are utilized for tracked robots, balancing robots, walking robots and autonomous planes.  1D simple sensor categories include Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Inclinometer.  Digital camera interfaces are possible in embedded systems, these represent the most complex type of camera sensors."/>
